### Problem Statement

An end-to-end mental health care management system that will help mental health patients in following two different flows-:

1) **First flow**:

 - The **patient** will first be allotted to a **counselor**, who will identify whether the patient has a mental health problem and if found to have one, will send the patient to the **Doctor**.
 - The **doctor** after diagonising the patient, will send him/her to the **Pharmacy** for taking medicines.
 - If the doctor finds that patient is suffering from a severe mental health problem, he/she will send the patient to **Rehab**.
 
2) **Second flow**:

 - This flow covers the case wherein a mental health patient is sent to jail after committing a crime.
 - Here, the **Prison Admin** will notice if a person admitted in the jail is suffering from a mental health issue by his/her daily activities. If he/she finds one, will send the **prisoner patient** to **counselor**.
 - **Counselor** will send the prisoner patient to the **doctor**.
 - If the **doctor** finds that prisoner patient is suffering from a sever mental health problem, he/she will reach out to **Legal Advisor** and explain him the issue and ask him to allow the prisoner patient be released from the jail and be sent to a Psychic Ward for treatment.
 - If the **Legal Advisor** finds doctor's request genuine, he/she will give an order to the **Police** to release prisoner patient from the jail.
 - The Prisoner Patient is now sent to a **Psychic Ward** for treatment.
